Rotation and the Coriolis Effect Planetary rota- tion affects global wind patterns through the Coriolis e ect (named for the French physicist who first explained it), which you can understand by thinking about a spinning merry-go- round (FIGURE 14). The outer parts of the merry-go-round move at a faster speed than the inner parts, because they have a greater distance to travel around the axis with each rotation. If you sit near the edge and roll a ball toward the center, the ball begins with your relatively high speed around the axis. As it rolls inward, the ballâ€™s high speed makes it move ahead of the slower-moving inner regions. On a merry-go-round rotating counterclockwise, the ball therefore deviates to the right instead of heading straight inward. The Coriolis effect also makes the ball deviate to the right if you roll it outward from a position near the center. In that case, the ball starts with your slower speed around the center and lags behind as it rolls outward to faster-moving regions, again deviating to the right. (If the merry-go-round rotates clockwise rather than counter- clockwise, the deviations go to the left instead of the right.)
